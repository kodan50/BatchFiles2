# Various Scripts! Yay!

# Batch scripts
These were tested to run in Windows 10. They may work in earlier flavors of Windows, but they are untested. They may also work in Windows 11, but if you are choosing of your own free will to use Windows 11, that's your problem, not mine.

# Python scrips
Tested in Python 3.10, as that was what I had installed at the time.

# Linux bin scripts
I use Debian based Linux, so it should be expected to work in any flavor that is based on Debian.

# Mac bin scrips
I use MacOS Mojave at work for certain repair jobs. The bin files here are tested to work with Mojave. They may work on other flavors of MacOS, but they won't be rewritten unless someone gifts me a newer Mac to use for work, which isn't likely to happen in the timeline we are stuck in.
On a quick note: Every time I've looked into a folder to Mac or Linux to put custom scripts in, it's always suggested to use the bin folder in home, and to create it if it doesn't exist, even though the files aren't binaries. I wonder why? Maybe scripts doesn't abbreviate well, and can be chunkier to write than ~/bin...
